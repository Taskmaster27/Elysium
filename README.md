# Elysium Dashboard WebApp

## Project Overview

Elysium is a modern webapp dashboard designed to showcase the power of free and accessible technologies. This project is a testament to what can be achieved using only free AI tools, open-source libraries, and creative problem-solving. If I gain access to more advanced technologies in the future, I plan to upgrade and make this dashboard fully functional. Until then, enjoy this free and open creation!

## Tech Stack

- **Framework:** Next.js (React)
- **Styling:** Tailwind CSS
- **3D Modeling:** Spline (free version)
- **AI Assistance:**
  - Project PRD: Claude Sonnet 3.7
  - App Development: Readdy AI

## Key Features

- Built entirely with free tools and resources
- Modular, component-based architecture
- Responsive design for all devices
- 3D elements integrated using Spline

## Getting Started

This project is built with [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) and was bootstrapped using [`create-next-app`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/cli/create-next-app).

To run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or

# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/optimizing/fonts) to automatically optimize and load [Geist](https://vercel.com/font), a new font family for Vercel.

## Learn More

To learn more about Next.js, take a look at the following resources:

- [Next.js Documentation](https://nextjs.org/docs) - learn about Next.js features and API.
- [Learn Next.js](https://nextjs.org/learn) - an interactive Next.js tutorial.

You can check out [the Next.js GitHub repository](https://github.com/vercel/next.js) - your feedback and contributions are welcome!

## Philosophy

This project was created with the goal of demonstrating that high-quality web applications can be built without paid tools or subscriptions. Every aspect, from planning to 3D modeling, leverages free AI and open-source solutions.

## Future Plans

If I get access to better technologies, I will upgrade Elysium to be even more powerful and fully functional. For now, this is a showcase of what is possible with free resources.
